The ggEZ provides a function for easily getting new code to solve elementary problems in ggplot, such as adding color and labels, and better visualizing hard to see data. It is designed as a shortcut to let users get more quickly acclimated to the oddities of programming in ggplot.




```{r setup}
library(ggEZ)
newPlot <- ggEZ("ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(  )", problem = "color")
newerPlot <- ggEZ(newPlot, problem = "clustered_data")  
print(newPlot)
print(newerPlot)
```
