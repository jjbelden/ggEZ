Description: Uses simple syntax to allow users to ask for recomendations on 
      ways to improve their ggplots. They may ask for help with color, labels, or 
      clustered data. The program will both graph modifications of their graph and 
      return the code, allowing the user to reproduce those graphs for themselves.
